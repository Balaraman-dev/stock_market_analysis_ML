# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM

This project predicts stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is trained on historical stock price data and deployed using Streamlit.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw and preprocessed datasets.
- **models/**: Contains the trained LSTM model in HDF5 format.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
- **app.py**: Main Streamlit application file.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.
- **utils.py**: Helper functions for preprocessing and visualization.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
